## Abstract

物种：红带袖蝶(寡食性)&青衫黄袖蝶(多食性)

Interspecies mating between H. melpomene and H. cydno (while rare on a per individual basis) does occur and is generally observed to occur between H. melpomene males and H. cydno females. These crosses result in sterile females, but fertile F1 males that can back-cross with either species.

H. cydno is a host plant generalist and, in Central America, H. melpomene is a host plant specialist. These differences in mating and oviposition may cause broad patterns of differential expression between H. cydno and H. melpomene.

Three sensory tissue types (antenna, legs, and mouthparts) and three biological groups (males, unmated females, and mated females).

With this design we were able to describe species-, sex-, and life-stage(mated vs. unmated) specific expression profiles that reflect important differences in mate and host plant choice for H. melpomene and H. cydno.

Chemosensory candidates are not in physical proximity to known wing-color pattern genes or other genomic regions associated with visual mate preference.

## Results

### Tissue-Specific Expression Recapitulate Sensory Function.

ORs and OBPs largely comprised antenna-specific genes, whereas CSPs, GRs, and OBPs generally comprised mouthpartand leg-specific genes.

### Sex-specific Expression Patterns Suggest OBPs as Mate Recognition Candidates
Sex-based expression differences observed between males and females may stem from their different evolutionary needs to recognize odorant volatiles during mate choice and host plant selection.

Moreover, genes showing conserved sex-based differences may precede the speciation of H. melpomene and H. cydno, making them more likely to correspond to broad differences in sex-specific traits.

### Life Stage–Specific Expression Suggests Sensory Shift in Antennae and Mated Females

Differences in chemosensory gene expression between unmated and mated females might reflect a change in sensory priorities from ==mate==

==choice (in unmated females)== to ==host plant choice for oviposition (in mated females)==.

### Species-Specific Expression Patterns Identify Potential Species Barriers

It is possible that this increased chemosensory expression corresponds to both ==host plant generalist behavior== and ==strict conspecific mate choice preferences== in H.cydno, behaviors that might require increasingly specialized and sensitive chemosensory discrimination genes.

### Patterns of Differential Expression in the Context of Admixture

Only one chemosensory gene, however, showed species level expression patterns consistent across biological groups and tissue type: HmOBP20 (q-value ≤ 0.001 for all comparisons). HmOBP20 was found to be overexpressed in H. melpomene antennae relative to H. cydno, and this pattern was observed in males, mated females, and unmated females (Fig. 5). As such, ==HmOBP20 presents a compelling candidate for species-specific recognition in H. melpomene.==

The most pronounced difference in expression is observed for HmGR56 in H. cydno male mouthparts. HmGR56 is a Heliconius-specific GR putatively involved in synephrine (a common plant alkaloid) recognition and may present an interesting candidate for host plant recognition.

### Genomic Locations of Chemosensory Genes and Linkage Disequilibrium

We found that chemosensory genes occur as small clusters, were present on every chromosome, and were spread across the genome. These clustering patterns were in line with expectations for genes originating from duplications as per the birth–death model of gene family evolution.

While close proximity (within 1 Mb) could indicate that the chemosensory genes are physically linked to the wing-pattern genes (in linkage disequi
librium, LD), none of these chemosensory genes were identified as candidates based on expression and admixture data.

Due to the association of color pattern with mate-preference behavior in H. melpomene and H. cydno, we specifically explored the levels of LD between our chemosensory genes (n = 252) and the optix color pattern interval.

## Discussion

Multiple studies support the importance of chemically mediated species boundaries, which indicate that species can differ in both the type and relative abundance of chemosensory genes that facilitate the detection of speciesspecific chemical cues, generally volatile odorants.

This increased chemosensory expression in H. cydno might, for example, confer males and females of this species a greater ability to distinguish conspecific mates or recognize a wider range of host plants.

This is particularly true for females, who select ovipositing sites in part by tasting the putative host plant surface with their forelegs, a behavior known as “drumming”. In agreement with these behavioral observations, we find that in H. cydno (a plant generalist) HmGR22, HmGR3, HmGR56, and HmGR5 are overexpressed in the legs and mouthparts of females.

We propose that HmOBP20 represents an independently evolved strategy for discrimination and reinforcement of species barriers in Heliconius. In addition to presenting strong species specific genomic signals, HmOBP20 is not physically linked with any of the classic color pattern genes (optix [chr18], WntA [chr10], and cortex [chr15]), nor is it linked to any of the previously identified male preference QTLs (chr1, chr17, chr18). Instead, it is located on a different chromosome (chr19).

## Detailed Materials and Methods

### Targeted Resequencing and Chemosensory Gene-Annotation Improvement

> Targeted resequencing is a variation of re-sequencing where only a small subset of the genome is sequenced, such as the exome, a particular chromosome, a set of genes or a region of interest. Focusing on a subset of the genome is generally done to reduce costs, although there may be certain cases, such as in a clinical setting, where it is important to sequence only particular regions. Also, by focusing all of the sequencing on a small region of the genome, it is possible to detect low levels of variation that might have otherwise been missed. Some researchers are starting to use targeted resequencing for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) instead of arrays as it is better suited for measuring rare alleles.

### Admixture and LD Analyses

==**Linkage Disequilibrium**==

> Chemosensory genes at the intercept of these two estimates are likely to be involved in species-specific processes. Finally, because the color pattern locus *optix* has been shown to be associated with mate preference behavior in *H. melpomene* and *H. cydno*, and linkage between chemosensory and color pattern genes could facilitate the forming of smell-based prezygotic barriers, we tested for the nonrandom association of chemosensory loci (50 kb around transcription start site) at and around the *optix* gene (1,000 kb region) in 50 kb windows. Pairwise comparisons of SNPs within each 50 kb window were averaged to produce a mean *r*2. 



 **==Admixture Values (*f~d~*)==**

> The admixture values (*f~d~*) are based on the ABBA-BABA test which measures an excess of derived allele sharing between the sympatric non-sister taxa compared to an allopatric population of *H. melpomene* from French Guiana. We included *H. numata* as an outgroup. Negative *f~d~* values indicate low admixture or sharing of derived alleles between the sympatric Panama populations of *H. melpomene* and *H. cydno* whereas positive *f~d~* values indicate high admixture. The *f~d~* values were calculated for 100 kb windows with a step size of 20 kb. For chemosensory genes overlapping windows were averaged.
